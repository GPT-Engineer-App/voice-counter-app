### Example Prompt:
```
I want to build a voice-controlled mobile application designed for counting different types of containers (PET, HDP, glass, carton) in a hands-free environment. The app should have the following features:
1. Voice-Activated Counting: Recognize pre-defined keywords and numbers, increment the count of the specified container type, and provide a real-time count display.
2. History Tracking: Store counts with timestamps, display the count history, and allow clearing or filtering by container type.
3. Data Export: Export count history in CSV format, allowing selection of specific container types or the entire history.
4. Lock Screen Display: Continue processing voice commands in the background and display current counts on the lock screen.
5. Container Lock-Out Feature: Allow locking out a specific container type and counting numbers for the locked-out container type.
6. Custom Keywords: Support custom keywords for each container type.
7. Settings Page: Provide fine-grained control over the app's settings, including voice control and counting functions, keyword inputs, and long-term history tracking.
8. Debugging and Log Capture: Include a page for debugging, log capture, and test conduction and analysis.
